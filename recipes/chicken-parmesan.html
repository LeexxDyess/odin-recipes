    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat Oven to 450 Degrees F</li><br>
        <li>Place chicken breasts between two<br>
            sheets of heavy plastic (resealable<br>
            freezer bags work well) on a solid, level<br>
            surface. Firmly pound chicken with the smooth<br>
            side of a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/2-inch.</li><br>
        <li>Season chicken thoroughly with salt and pepper. Using<br>
            a sifter or strainer; sprinkle flour over chicken<br>
            breasts, evenly coating both sides.</li><br>
        <li>Beat eggs in a shallow bowl and set aside.</li><br>
        <li>Mix bread crumbs and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese in a<br>
            separate bowl, set aside.</li><br>
        <li>Dip a flour-coated chicken breast in beaten eggs.<br>
            Transfer breast to the bread crumb mixture, pressing<br>
            crumbs into both sides. Repeat for each breast. Let chicken<br>
            rest for 10 to 15 minutes.</li><br>
        <li>Heat 1/2 inch olive oil in a large<br>
            skillet on medium-high heat until it <br>
            begins to shimmer. Cook chicken in the hot<br>
            oil until golden, about 2 minutes per side. The <br>
            chicken will finish cooking in the oven.</li><br>
        <li>Transfer chicken to a baking dish. Top each breast <br>
            with 2 tablespoons tomato sauce. Layer each chicken <br>
            breast with equal amounts of mozzarella cheese, fresh <br>
            basil, and provolone cheese. Sprinkle remaining Parmesan <br>
            over top and drizzle each with 1/2 teaspoon olive oil.</li><br>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned and bubbly <br>
            and chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20 <br>
            minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center <br>
            should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
